# Lex-SQL-StudentProject-Rockbuster
### Summary
This student project I completed with CareerFoundry centered on extracting relevant data with PostgreSQL in PgAdmin4.
In this repository, you can view some of the SQL queries I used to do this as well as the Tableau presentation I synthesized from that data.
### Project Premise
A fictional movie rental company, "Rockbuster, LLC," is transitioning its business model from retail video rental to online streaming. My analysis focuses on deriving insights from Rockbuster's database to better understand the performance of movies in its library as well as the tastes and profile information of its existing customer base.
